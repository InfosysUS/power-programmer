# Hiring Process

We put time and effort into hiring at Infosys to ensure the process is fair, efficient and transparent.

Our goal is to see if there will be a match in terms of your technical and communication skills as well as a cultural fit. We’re not looking for clones of our existing engineering team, but more people who want to help take themselves and Infosys to the next level, while having some fun along the way! Equally, we have set up the process to give you an insight into what it's like to work here, a clear view of what problems you’d be working on, and an idea about whether or not you’d be excited about collaborating with the Infosys team.

Here’s what you can expect when applying to be a Power Programmer at Infosys.

###### 1. Applying :fireworks:

Applying to be a Power Programmer at Infosys is quick and easy. All we ask is for you to send us your full name, your email and your stack via youbringthepower.com

After you hit submit, you'll receive an email confirmation and your application will be reviewed and responded to by our Recruitment team within 3 days.

###### 2. Video Screening :tv:

If our engineers think you could be a good fit, we will send you a link to complete a short video interview, where you will be asked to answer three simple questions.

* Tell me about a time when you went above and beyond?
* Tell me about a time you overcame a challenge?
* Tell me about the most complex project you’ve ever worked on?

###### 3. HR screening :telephone_receiver:

Next up is a 30-45 minute phone call with one of our technical recruiters. The goal of this call is to get to know each other and see if there could be a match both ways: we’ll go through the competency framework, your fit for the role and talk about what it’s like to code at Infosys. 

It’s hard to tell everything in this call, but we hope to get a good idea about your level of knowledge on different topics to see what areas you could add value, and what areas we could help you to grow. 

If the decision is positive, we will discuss setting up the final technical interview.

###### 4. Technical Interview  :computer:

This interview is carried out by video call (usually on Skype) and will be with senior Infosys Power Programmers. The purpose of this step is to verify that you have the coding chops required to be a Power Programmer. You’ll have two choices; 
* Complete a coding challenge on Hackerrank 
* Or jump on a screenshare and open any choice of editor; we will provide a problem and ask you to solve it.

###### 5. Decision :relieved:

After the final interview, all interviewers will sit together to discuss the feedback and come to a mutual decision. This will be communicated to you within a few days of the final interview. In the event we decide not to progress, the recruiter will give you a call to discuss the feedback in detail.

If we decide that you are the perfect match for us, we’ll call you to tell you the news and make you an offer! If you accept, you’ll begin the relocation and/or onboarding process.

###### 6. Onboarding  :wave:

Yes! You made it and are now a Power Programmer! Awesome. The final step is to start life at Infosys. There will be an official ‘onboarding’ day with other new joiners (across different departments) as well as a full technical onboarding and orientation so you can get up to speed quickly. In your first week, you will have an appointment with HR for the last pieces of paperwork.

We're a friendly and international bunch so there's a good chance that lots of the people you speak to here have been through a similar process and can share their top tips and tricks for getting settled in, whether it’s the best neighborhoods to live in or the best pizza restaurant to order takeaway from! No matter what happens, Infosys is here to support you along every step your journey.
