## Why become a Power Programmer?
We designed the Power Programmer career track for polyglots who want more than programming-as-usual – for software engineers who are experts across multiple technologies and who have the power to play the role of a full-stack developer in complex engineering projects.

The work is complex, but the concept is simple; you bring the power, and we’ll give you the freedom to shape the future of technology.

### A career progression built around your passion

The Power Programmer track is a three-step career ladder that takes you from Specialist Programmer to Principal Technologist – and every step of the way your role is 100% focused on programming.

### Less meetings, more coding

We won’t waste your talent on pointless meetings, bureaucracy or box-ticking. Infosys Power Programmers are given the freedom to focus on their passion: programming.

### Why work for one of the smartest companies in Silicon Valley, when you could work for them all?

Working across a startling array of products, technologies and organisations, there is always a surfeit of new problems for Power Programmers to find and solve. It’s like being a freelancer, but with the security of a highly-competitive paycheck.
