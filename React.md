# React

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library we Power Programmers use to build user interfaces. 

The big idea behind React is this: what if you could create your own HTML element that has customized functionality? For example, we can make a ‘CommentBox’ element that will display a text area, run validations on the text typed into the text area, submit the form when the enter key is pressed, etc — all just by including one line of code. For those of you coming from the Angular world, you can think of React Components as a close analogy to Directives.

React is also capable of becoming an entire replacement for your views because you can nest components, composing complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code. The beauty of this structure is that all HTML and javascript functionality is enclosed in its respective React component, which makes reading (and building) the code of large applications significantly easier and faster.
