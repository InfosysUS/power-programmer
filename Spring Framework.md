# Spring Framework

Spring Framework is a Java platform we Power Programmers use to handle comprehensive infrastructure support when we’re developing Java applications. 

By using Spring Framework, we can build applications from “plain old Java objects” and apply enterprise services to them non-invasively. This capability applies to the Java SE programming model and to full and partial Java EE.

It smartly chooses dependencies, auto-configures features, and we can start our application with one click. It also simplifies the deployment process of our application.

A few examples of when Spring comes in handy:

* We can make a Java method execute in a database transaction without having to deal with transaction APIs.
* We can make a local Java method a remote procedure without having to deal with remote APIs.
* We can make a local Java method a management operation without having to deal with JMX APIs.
* We can make a local Java method a message handler without having to deal with JMS APIs.
