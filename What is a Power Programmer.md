### Am I a Power Programmer?
Let’s hope so!

Power Programmers have the ability to design, develop and troubleshoot applications developed on multiple languages and technologies in rapid sprints. You don’t need to be an expert in every area but you should know about many and have deep expertise in at least one.

Possessing strong communication skills, you have the experience and desire to work in a global delivery environment. Capable of understanding and challenging client requirements, you’re never scared of expressing their expert opinion or perspective. 
Last, and certainly not least, Power Programmers love analysing (and discovering) complex problems and have experience with all phases of software development across requirement gathering, high level design, low level design, build and unit testing, system integration testing, UAT support and production go live activities.
