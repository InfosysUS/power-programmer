# Jira

JIRA is a tool that we Power Programmers use for bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management. The name "JIRA" is inherited from the Japanese word "Gojira" which translates into everybody’s favourite monster blockbuster, "Godzilla".

The basic use of this tool is to track issue and bugs related to your software and Mobile apps. It is also used for project management. The JIRA dashboard consists of many useful functions and features which make handling of issues easy.

It combines:

* Issue tracking -  a software application that allows to record and follow the progress of every problem or "issue" that user identifies until the problem is resolved.
* Agile project management - an iterative approach to planning and guiding project processes.
customizable workflow, and a pluggable integration - integrates with Freshdesk, GitHub, Zendesk, Zapbook, Asana and so on.
* The kanban board to increase the velocity - consist of to do/in progress/in review/done divisions
