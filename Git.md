# Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

By far the most widely used modern version control system in the world today, Git is a mature, actively-maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source.

We find that Git is easy to learn, has a tiny footprint, and offers lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN), in Git, every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.
