# MongoDB

MongoDB is a document database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time. At Infosys, we work closely with MongoDB to quickly and efficiently create state-of-the-art, high performance and scalable applications. 

Its flexible data model, dynamic schema and scalability provide many key benefits that are ideal for application modernization – making it an excellent tool in the many disruptive digital transformation projects we work on. In particular, MongoDB’s ability to scale horizontally helps our clients to quickly expand their services in the market.

For example, our Digital Agriculture solution, with MongoDB at its core, addresses the demand for higher yield within limited farm acreage and severe scarcity of water for irrigation, unleashing the power of data and IoT to surpass gargantuan challenges with a model that is scalable, flexible and responsive.
