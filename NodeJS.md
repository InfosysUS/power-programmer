# Node JS

Node.js is a an open source server environment that we Power Programmers use to run single-threaded, non-blocking, memory-efficient asynchronous programming.

Node.js is great for:
* Generate dynamic page content
* Create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
* Collect form data
* Add, delete, modify data in your database

Node.js came into existence when the original developers of JavaScript extended it from something you could only run in the browser to something you could run on your machine as a standalone application.

It runs a single-threaded event loop registered with the system to handle connections, and each new connection causes a JavaScript callback function to fire. The callback function can handle requests with non-blocking I/O calls, and if necessary can spawn threads from a pool to execute blocking or CPU-intensive operations and to load-balance across CPU cores. Node’s approach to scaling with callback functions requires less memory to handle more connections than most competitive architectures that scale with threads, including Apache HTTP Server, the various Java application servers, IIS and ASP.NET, and Ruby on Rails.
