# How We Work

Power Programmers don’t have a manifesto, but if we did, it would go something like this:

:zap: __We’re *fast*__

Working in rapid sprints with an agile methodology, we solve problems fast. When we run out of problems, we find new ones to solve. 

:computer: __We focus on programming__

We want to do what excites us: coding. We’re not saddled with goals that are irrelevant to technology. We don’t ask boring questions. We don’t want to be architects. 

:smiling_imp: __We’re different__

We look at the world differently. We answer questions that others have never even asked. We generate creative solutions to complex problems.

:dancers: __We’re an elite team__

We are a team of best-in-class programmers. Every day we collaborate, and every day we challenge each other to become better at what we do. 

:fist: __We aren’t afraid to express our expertise__

We are capable of understanding *and* challenging client requirements. We are the experts, after all.

:star: __We’re native__

Because we’re often working client-side, and because our clients are among the smartest in Silicon Valley, we identify with our clients as much as we do with Infosys.

:bowtie: __We love learning__

In our world, agility is key. We learn new technologies fast – not because we’re told to, but because we want to be the first to experiment with exciting new tech.

:revolving_hearts: __We love diverse workflows__

We hate doing the same thing over and over again. That’s why we work with a plethora of clients and projects and technologies and locations.

:muscle: __We know that our differences make all the difference__

We are of varying backgrounds, interests, genders and orientations; from more than 100 nations; operating out of almost 200 locations worldwide. But we all have an equal enthusiasm to bring all of our unique selves to help create a better future together – one that’s a reflection of our collective aspirations.
